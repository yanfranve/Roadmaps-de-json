The default sorting key is pid, but other keys can be used instead. Various output options are available.htop is a cross-platform ncurses-based process. It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using a pointing device (mouse). You can observe all processes running on the system, along with their command line arguments, as well as view them in a tree format, select multiple processes and act on them all at once.Lsof lists on its standard output file information about files opened by processes.",

Some of the most common networking tools are: traceroute, ping, mtr, nmap, netstat, ufw and firewalld, iptables and nftables, tcpdump, dig, scp.traceroute command is a command in Linux that prints the route a network packet takes from its source (e.g. your computer) to the destination host (e.g., roadmap.sh). It is quite valuable in investigating slow network connections as it can help us spot the slow leg of the network packet journey through the internet.ping (Packet Internet Groper) command is used to check the network connectivity between host and server/host. This command takes as input the IP address or the URL and sends a data packet to the specified address with the message “PING” and get a response from the server/host this time is recorded which is called latency.mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a single network diagnostic tool.NMAP stands for Network Mapper and is an open-source tool used to explore and audit the network’s security, such as checking firewalls and scanning ports.Netstat is a command line utility to display all the network connections on a system. It displays all the tcp, udp and unix socket connections. Apart from connected sockets it also displays listening sockets that are waiting for incoming connections.UFW, or uncomplicated firewall, is command-line based utility for managing firewall rules in Arch Linux, Debian and Ubuntu. It’s aim is to make firewall configuration as simple as possible. It is a frontend for the iptables firewalling tool.IPtables is a command-line firewall utility that uses policy chains to allow or block traffic that will be enforced by the linux kernel’s netfilter framework. Iptables packet filtering mechanism is organized into three different kinds of structures: tables, chains and targets.tcpdump is a command line tool used for analysing network traffic passing through your system. It can be used to capture and filter packets and display them in a human-readable format. The captured information can be analysed at a later date as well.dig command stands for Domain Information Groper. It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers. It is mostly used by network administrators for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups. It replaces older tools such as nslookup and the host.SCP is an acronym for Secure Copy Protocol.It is a command line utility that allows the user to securely copy files and directories between two locations usually between unix or linux systems.The protocol ensures the transmission of files is encrypted to prevent anyone with suspicious intentions from getting sensitive information.SCP uses encryption over an SSH (Secure Shell) connection, this ensures that the data being transferred is protected from suspicious attacks.",

            "description": "Some of the most common commands you will use in the terminal are text manipulation commands. These commands allow you to search, replace, and manipulate text in files and streams. Here are some of the most common commands you will use: awk, sed, grep, sort, cut, uniq, cat, echo, fmt, tr, nl, wc.awk is a general-purpose scripting language used for manipulating data or text and generating reports in the Linux world. It is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that match the specified patterns and then performs the associated actions.sed(Stream Editor) command in UNIX can perform lots of functions on file like searching, finding and replacing, insertion or deletion. By using SED you can edit files even without opening them in editors like VI Editor.The grep command (global search for regular expression and print out) searches file(s) for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. It can be used with other commands like ps making it more useful.sort command is used to sort the contents of a file in a particular order. By default, it sorts a file assuming the contents are in ASCII. But it also can also be used to sort numerically by using appropriate options.The cut utility cuts out selected portions of each line (as specified by list) from each file and writes them to the standard output.The uniq utility reads the specified input_file comparing adjacent lines, and writes a copy of each unique input line to the output_file.cat (concatenate) command is very frequently used in Linux. It reads data from the file and gives its content as output. It helps us to create, view, and concatenate files.echo is a built-in command in Linux used to display lines of text/string that are passed as an argument. It is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text or ENV variables to the screen or a file.fmt command is for formatting and optimizing contents in text files. It will be really useful when it comes to beautify large text files by setting uniform column width and spaces.The tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of selected characters.The nl utility reads lines from the named file or the standard input if the file argument is omitted, applies a configurable line numbering filter operation and writes the result to the standard output.The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.",

Examples of secret stores include Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Google Cloud Secret Manager.Encryption: Secrets can be encrypted using a variety of encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES, RSA, and PGP. Encrypted secrets can be stored in a variety of locations, such as a file system, a database, or a cloud storage service.Access controls: Access to secrets should be restricted to only those users or systems that need them, using techniques such as role-based access controls, multi-factor authentication, and least privilege principles.Effective secret management is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of a DevOps environment.

It is based on the idea that all changes to the system, whether they are related to code, configuration, or infrastructure, should be made using Git and that Git should be used to automate the deployment and management of those changes. In a GitOps workflow, changes to the system are made by committing code or configuration changes to a Git repository. These changes are then automatically deployed to the production environment using a continuous delivery pipeline. The pipeline is triggered by changes to the Git repository and is responsible for building, testing, and deploying the changes to the production environment.GitOps is designed to be a more efficient and agile way of managing cloud-native environments, as it allows developers to make changes to the system using familiar tools and processes and it provides a clear and auditable history of all changes to the system. It is often used in conjunction with tools such as Kubernetes and Helm to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.",

Availability can be affected by hardware or software errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load. Many cloud providers typically offer their users a service level agreement (SLA) that specifies the exact percentages of promised uptime/downtime. Availability is related to reliability in this sense. For example, a company might promise 99.99% uptime for their services. To achieve high levels of uptime, it is important to eliminate single points of failure so that a single device failure does not disrupt the entire service. High availability in the cloud is often achieved by creating clusters. Clusters are groups of devices (such as servers) that all have access to the same shared storage and function as one single server to provide uninterrupted availability. This way, if one server goes down, the others are able to pick up the load until it comes back online. Clusters can range from two servers to even multiple buildings of servers.",
