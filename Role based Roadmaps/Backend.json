NoSQL databases typically focus more on horizontal scaling, eventual consistency, speed and flexibility and is used commonly for big data and real-time streaming applications. NoSQL is often described as a BASE system (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) as opposed to SQL/relational which typically focus on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Common NoSQL data structures include key-value pair, wide column, graph and document.\nVisit the following resources to learn more ",

These tools allow you to see the overall CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system, which can help identify any resource bottlenecks.\nUse database-specific tools: Most database management systems (DBMSs) have their own tools for monitoring performance. For example, Microsoft SQL Server has the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the sys.dm_os_wait_stats dynamic management view, while Oracle has the Oracle Enterprise Manager and the v$waitstat view. These tools allow you to see specific performance metrics, such as the amount of time spent waiting on locks or the number of physical reads and writes.\nUse third-party tools: There are also several third-party tools that can help you profile the performance of a database. Some examples include SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer, Quest Software Foglight, and Redgate SQL Monitor. These tools often provide more in-depth performance analysis and can help you identify specific issues or bottlenecks.\nAnalyze slow queries: If you have specific queries that are running slowly, you can use tools like EXPLAIN PLAN or SHOW PLAN in MySQL or SQL Server to see the execution plan for the query and identify any potential issues. You can also use tools like the MySQL slow query log or the SQL Server Profiler to capture slow queries and analyze them further.\nMonitor application performance: If you are experiencing performance issues with a specific application that is using the database, you can use tools like Application Insights or New Relic to monitor the performance of the application and identify any issues that may be related to the database.\nHave a look at the documentation for the database that you are using.",

It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This allows clients to request only the data that they need, and it reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network. GraphQL also provides a way to define the structure of the data that is returned from the server, allowing clients to request data in a predictable and flexible way. This makes it easier to build and maintain client applications that depend on data from the server. GraphQL is widely used in modern web and mobile applications, and it is supported by a large and active developer community.",

It is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). In a SAML-based system, a user requests access to a protected resource. The service provider asks the identity provider to authenticate the user and assert whether they are granted access to the resource.\n\nBenefits of SAML\nSome advantages of using SAML include:\n\n- Single Sign-On (SSO): Users can log in once at the IdP and access multiple service providers without needing to authenticate again.\n- Improved security: Passwords and user credentials are not required to be stored and managed by the service provider, reducing the potential vectors for attack.\n- Increased efficiency: As users no longer need to maintain multiple sets of credentials, managing access becomes easier for both the user and the system administrators.\n- Interoperability: SAML enables a wide range of applications to work together, regardless of the underlying technology or platform.\n\nSAML Components\nThree main components are involved in the SAML architecture:\n\n- Identity Provider (IdP): The entity that manages users’ identities and authenticates them by providing security tokens, also called assertions.\n- Service Provider (SP): The entity that provides a service (such as a web application or API) and relies on the identity provider to authenticate users and grant/deny access to the resources.\n- User/Principal: The end user seeking access to the service provided by the service provider.\n\nSAML Workflow\nThe SAML authentication process consists of the following steps:\n\n1. The user requests access to a protected resource from the service provider.\n2. If the user is not already authenticated, the service provider generates and sends a SAML authentication request to the identity provider.\n3. The identity provider authenticates the user (using, e.g., a username and password, multi-factor authentication, or another method).\n4. The identity provider constructs a SAML response, which includes details about the user and asserts whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource.\n5. The SAML response is sent back to the service provider, typically via the user’s web browser or API client.\n6. The service provider processes the SAML response, extracts the necessary information, and grants or denies access to the user based on the identity provider’s assertion.\n\nWith SAML, you can streamline user authentication and authorization across various applications and systems, providing a better user experience and improving your overall backend security.",

                            "description": "Memcached (pronounced variously mem-cash-dee or mem-cashed) is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS) and on Microsoft Windows. It depends on the libevent library.\nMemcached’s APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in the least recently used (LRU) order. Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database.\nMemcached has no internal mechanism to track misses which may happen. However, some third-party utilities provide this functionality.\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

This can be useful for debugging and for tracking the evolution of the system over time.\nEvent sourcing is often used in conjunction with other patterns, such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and domain-driven design, to build scalable and responsive systems with complex business logic.

They store and retrieve data based on unique indexes, which allow for fast and accurate searches. As a backend developer, understanding search engines functionalities, and how to integrate them into your web application, is crucial.\n\nThere are two primary types of search engines:\nFull-text search engines: These are specifically designed for searching and analyzing text documents. They can efficiently index large volumes of text and provide relevant results based on keywords or phrases. Popular full-text search engines examples include Elasticsearch, Solr, and Amazon CloudSearch.\nDatabase search engines: Database engines are built-in features of most databases. They provide search capabilities within the data stored in the database. Examples include MySQL FULLTEXT search and PostgreSQL Full-Text Search.\n\n Key Concepts\nWhen dealing with search engines, it’s important to understand these key concepts:\nIndexing: The process of analyzing and storing data in an optimized format for fast search and retrieval.\nTokenization: Breaking text into individual words or terms (also known as tokens), for efficient indexing and searching.\nQuerying: The act of searching the indexed data by asking a specific question or requesting information based on keywords or phrases.\nRelevance scoring: A score assigned to each search result that indicates how closely it matches the query, based on algorithms and relevance models.\n\nIntegration\nTo integrate a search engine into your web application, you would typically follow these steps:\nChoose the search engine: Identify the search engine that best suits your application’s needs, considering factors such as scalability, performance, and ease of integration.\nIndex your data: Analyze and store your data using the chosen search engine. This process may involve creating an index, specifying fields, and defining how the data should be tokenized and analyzed.\nImplement search functionality: Develop the backend code for handling search requests, such as sending queries to the search engine and parsing the responses. Additionally, make sure to handle user inputs, like keywords, phrases, and filters.\nDisplay search results: Design the frontend of your application to show search results in a user-friendly manner, including pagination, sorting, and filters.",

It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.\nTo use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events.

It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to prevent cascading failures and to improve the resilience and availability of a system.\nA circuit breaker consists of three states: closed, open, and half-open. In the closed state, the circuit breaker allows operations to proceed as normal. If the system encounters a failure or becomes overloaded, the circuit breaker moves to the open state, and all subsequent operations are immediately stopped. After a specified period of time, the circuit breaker moves to the half-open state, and a small number of operations are allowed to proceed. If these operations are successful, the circuit breaker moves back to the closed state; if they fail, the circuit breaker moves back to the open state.\nThe circuit breaker design pattern is useful for protecting a system from failures or excessive load by providing a way to temporarily stop certain operations and allow the system to recover. It is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as retries and fallbacks, to provide a more robust and resilient cloud environment.\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

In the context of web development, graceful degradation refers to the ability of a web page or application to continue functioning, even if the user’s browser or device does not support certain features or technologies.\nGraceful degradation is often used as an alternative to progressive enhancement, a design principle that states that a system should be designed to take advantage of advanced features and technologies if they are available.\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
