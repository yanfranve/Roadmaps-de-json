In games, the server-side is responsible for the logic and rules of the game, data persistence, security, and synchronization of the game state among all connected clients. It essentially handles all processing that isn’t done on the client-side. Code run on the server-side can be written in various programming languages, but it’s often in PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, Java, or JavaScript (Node.js). Knowing server-side programming is critical for any game developer to create maintainable, scalable, and secure online games. ",

During this communication, TCP ensures that data is not lost or received out of order by providing error checking mechanisms and a system for retransmission of lost data. Furthermore, to ensure efficient use of network resources, TCP implements flow control, congestion control and provides a means for hosts to dynamically adjust the throughput of the connection.",

However, if the computed values don’t match, TCP will detect a possible change in received data, and the receiver will request for the re-transmission of the lost or corrupted data packets.

Reliable transmission is particularly necessary for critical data where all transmitted information must arrive at the destination correctly and in the right order.

It involves a DHCP server, which is responsible for allocating IP addresses and controlling the process. This server maintains a pool of IP addresses, which it assigns to devices as they connect to the network. DHCP also handles release and renewal of these IP addresses as devices leave and rejoin the network.",

In programming, threads are a way to improve the application responsiveness and perform multiple operations simultaneously without requiring multiple CPUs or computers. Threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can, therefore, communicate more quickly with each other than if they were separate processes. Developers often use multithreading in server-side game development to manage complex operations with high efficiency. ",

It refers to the idea that operations or processes are executed ‘in sync’, meaning that the next operation starts strictly after the previous operation has already finished. In a synchronous communication, for instance, the sender can’t start a new communication until the receiver confirmed receiving the last parcel. It’s different from “asynchrony” where various operations can run concurrently, not waiting for previous operations to finish before moving on. Overall, understanding the concepts of synchrony and asynchrony are crucial for making efficient use of resources in server-side game development, and picking the right approach depends on the specific use case and requirements.",

This model is called ‘reactive’ because the server only acts or ‘reacts’ when it receives a request from the client. The “update process” plays a vital role in this model. It’s the server’s responsibility to keep the game world updated and synchronized among all players. This updating process is typically done in a loop that processes all the changes that happen in the game like players’ actions, NPC movements, in-game events or game physics. It updates the game world and informs the players about the changes. Also, if a player makes changes like moving a character or attacking an enemy, it sends this information to the server adding it to the update loop.
