It all comes down to fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the consumer in terms of the product’s usefulness, design, dependability, durability, and price.Assurance is nothing more than a confident statement made about a good or service. It is the assurance that a good outcome is guaranteed for a good or service. It offers a warranty that the product will perform faultlessly in accordance with expectations or needs.Quality Assurance (QA) also known as QA testing is an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release. ",

While both are intended to solve the same problem, they use different strategies.\n\nWhat is responsive design?\nA website created with responsive design serves up the same site to every device, but that site is fluid and will change its layout and appearance based on the size and orientation of the device.\nDevelopers use CSS to ensure each page of the site can reformat based on the size of the user’s viewport and only need to create one codebase for the site. They use something called breakpoints to tell the site when to adjust to accommodate different screen sizes.\nThe majority of new sites now use responsive, which has been made easier for less experienced designers and developers, thanks to the availability of themes accessible through CMS systems such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.\nResponsive design does not offer as much control as adaptive but takes much less work to both build and maintain. Responsive layouts are also fluid, and while adaptive can and do use percentages to give a more fluid feel when scaling, these can again cause a jump when a window is resized.\n\nWhat is adaptive design?\nIn adaptive design, a different website layout is created for each device’s screen. As it loads, the site recognizes the size of the screen and serves up the layout that was made for that viewport. In fact, you can create a different user experience for each of six common screen sizes from very small to very large: 320px, 480px, 760px, 960px, 1200px, and 1600px.\nAdaptive is useful for retrofitting an existing site to make it more suitable for mobile phones. This allows you to take control of the design and web development for specific, multiple viewports. The number of viewports that you choose to design for is entirely up to you, your company, and your overall budget. It does, however, afford you a certain amount of control (for example over content and layout) that you will not necessarily have using responsive design.",

Selenium itself is an open-source, automated testing tool used to test web applications across various browsers. It’s primarily built in Java and supports several browsers and programming languages. Selenium IDE was developed to speed up the creation of automation scripts. It’s a rapid prototyping tool and can be used by engineers with no programming knowledge whatsoever. Because of its simplicity, Selenium IDE is best used as a prototyping tool and not a complete solution for developing and maintaining complex test suites.",

WebdriverIO leverages the power of the WebDriver protocol that is developed and supported by all browser vendors and guarantees a true cross-browser testing experience. While other automation tools require you to download modified browser that aren’t used by actual users or emulate user behavior by injecting JavaScript, WebdriverIO relies on a common agreed standard for automation that is properly tested and ensures compatibility for decades to come.During the development of this automation standard the web has changed a lot and many of the requirements that developers have today to test their web application can not be fulfilled using WebDriver anymore. While some of the core contributors of this project help support the next generation of the WebDriver protocol, WebdriverIO provides an alternative automation solution based on the Chrome DevTools protocol. This allows the user to seamlessly switch between conventional commands based on WebDriver and powerful browser interactions through Puppeteer.",

There are three objectives (three S) of Performance testing to observe and evaluate: Speed, Scalability, and Stability. Following are the commonly used performance testing types, but not limited to: Load Testing, Stress Testing, Spike Testing, Endurance Testing, Volume Testing, Scalability Testing, Capacity Testing. Load Testing is one type of performance testing. It helps to evaluate the application under tests’ behaviors such as response time, throughput, pass/fail transactions, and more under the normal workload.

Gatling’s architecture is asynchronous as long as the underlying protocol, such as HTTP, can be implemented in a non-blocking way.

An automated build checks every integration to detect errors in this method. In Continuous Integration, the software is built and tested immediately after a code commit. In a large project with many developers, commits are made many times during the day. With each commit, code is built and tested. Continuous Delivery is a software engineering method in which a team develops software products in a short cycle. It ensures that software can be easily released at any time. The main aim of continuous delivery is to build, test, and release software with good speed and frequency. It helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for frequent updates in production.",
