Abstract Classes: provide a base class that can be extended to create multiple concrete implementations.

Isolates: allow running Dart code in separate threads with communication through message passing. Futures: represent a value that will be available at some point in the future. Null-aware operators (??, ?.): provide a concise way to handle null values. Collection literals: provide concise syntax for creating collections.

Concurrent Execution: Isolates provide a way to run multiple tasks concurrently, allowing you to improve the overall performance of your app. Isolation: Each Isolate runs in its own memory space and is isolated from other Isolates. This makes it easier to write reliable and secure code. Communication: Flutter provides a mechanism for communicating between Isolates, allowing them to share data and coordinate their work.
