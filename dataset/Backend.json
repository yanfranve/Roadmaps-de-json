Here's a simple example demonstrating Go’s concurrency:package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc printMessage(message string) {\n    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {\n        fmt.Println(message)\n        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    go printMessage(\"Goroutine 1\")\n    go printMessage(\"Goroutine 2\")\n\n    time.Sleep(4 * time.Second) // wait for goroutines to finish\n    fmt.Println(\"Main function finished\")\n}\nThis program runs two goroutines concurrently, showing how Go makes it easy to handle multiple tasks at once."

Here’s an example of defining a simple service in gRPC using Protocol Buffers:syntax = \"proto3\";\n\nservice Greeter {\n  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}\n}\n\nmessage HelloRequest {\n  string name = 1;\n}\n\nmessage HelloReply {\n  string message = 1;\n}\n"

Understanding CORS can help you design more secure applications, especially as they scale.\n\nExample 2\nConversacion:\nHow do I enable CORS for my API?\n\nChosen:\nTo enable CORS for your API, you need to set specific HTTP headers in your server's response. Here’s an example using Node.js with the Express framework:\n\njavascript\nCopiar código\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); // Allows all origins\n    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,POST,PUT,DELETE'); // Allowed methods\n    next();\n});\n\napp.get('/api/resource', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({ message: 'CORS enabled!' });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n    console.log('Server running on port 3000');\n});\nRejected:\nYou can enable CORS by just adding a comment in your code saying \"CORS is allowed.\" That should work fine.\n\nSugerencia de mejora:\nCORS requires specific HTTP headers to function properly, so it's essential to implement them in your server's response, as shown in the example.\n\nExample 3\nConversacion:\nI'm having issues with CORS when making requests to an external API. How can I troubleshoot this?\n\nChosen:\nWhen facing CORS issues, first check the browser's console for error messages related to CORS. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:\n\nCheck Preflight Requests: Ensure the server responds to the preflight OPTIONS request correctly with the appropriate headers.\nVerify Allowed Origins: Make sure the server's Access-Control-Allow-Origin header includes your requesting origin.\nInspect Allowed Methods: Confirm that the server allows the HTTP methods you are trying to use (GET, POST, etc.).\nHere’s an example of a preflight request in JavaScript using Fetch:fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {\n    method: 'GET',\n    headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    },\n    mode: 'cors' // Enable CORS mode\n})\n.then(response => {\n    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n    return response.json();\n})\n.then(data => console.log(data))\n.catch(error => console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error));\n"

This leads to more maintainable and flexible systems that can adapt to changing business requirements.\n\nHere's a simple example of defining a domain model with an entity in Python:class Product:\n    def __init__(self, id, name, price):\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.price = price\n\n    def apply_discount(self, percentage):\n        self.price -= self.price * (percentage / 100)\n\n# Usage\nproduct = Product(1, \"Widget\", 100)\nproduct.apply_discount(10)\nprint(product.price)  # Output: 90.0\n"

Here's a simple example demonstrating Go’s concurrency:package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc printMessage(message string) {\n    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {\n        fmt.Println(message)\n        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    go printMessage(\"Goroutine 1\")\n    go printMessage(\"Goroutine 2\")\n\n    time.Sleep(4 * time.Second) // wait for goroutines to finish\n    fmt.Println(\"Main function finished\")\n}\nThis program runs two goroutines concurrently, showing how Go makes it easy to handle multiple tasks at once."

It was designed with a built-in salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and features an adaptive cost factor, which allows you to adjust its processing time as computing power increases. This adaptability ensures that passwords hashed with bcrypt remain resistant to brute-force attacks over time. Most modern programming languages and frameworks include bcrypt implementations, making it easy to use across different platforms.\n\nHere’s a basic example in Node.js using bcrypt:const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\nconst password = 'userPassword123';\nconst saltRounds = 10;\n\nbcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(hash); // Store the hashed password securely\n});\n"

As a rule of thumb, you should choose a value that takes around 100 milliseconds to hash a password on your system. This ensures sufficient security without impacting performance too much.\n\nYou can adjust the cost factor like this in Node.js:const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');\nconst password = 'userPassword123';\nconst costFactor = 12; // Adjust this value based on your server performance\n\nbcrypt.hash(password, costFactor, function(err, hash) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(hash); // Store the hashed password securely\n});\n"

It allows servers to specify which domains are permitted to access their resources via HTTP headers. This mechanism helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data while enabling legitimate requests across different origins, which is essential for modern web applications that often rely on resources from various domains.\n\nRejected:\nCORS is just a way to allow any website to access any resource without any restrictions. It's not very important if you're building a small web application.\n\nSugerencia de mejora:\nEven for small applications, CORS is crucial as it protects your resources from unauthorized access. Understanding CORS can help you design more secure applications, especially as they scale.\n\nExample 2\nConversacion:\nHow do I enable CORS for my API?\n\nChosen:\nTo enable CORS for your API, you need to set specific HTTP headers in your server's response.
