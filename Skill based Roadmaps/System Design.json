It involves taking a problem statement, breaking it down into smaller components, and designing each component to work together effectively to achieve the overall goal of the system. This process typically includes analyzing the current system (if any) and determining any deficiencies, creating a detailed plan for the new system, and testing the design to ensure that it meets the requirements. It is an iterative process that may involve multiple rounds of design, testing, and refinement. In software engineering, system design is a phase in the software development process that focuses on the high-level design of a software system, including the architecture and components. It is also one of the important aspects of the interview process for software engineers. Most of the companies have a dedicated system design interview round, where they ask the candidates to design a system for a given problem statement. The candidates are expected to come up with a detailed design of the system, including the architecture, components, and their interactions. They are also expected to discuss the trade-offs involved in their design and the alternatives that they considered.",

            "description": "There are several steps that can be taken when approaching a system design. Understand the problem: Gather information about the problem you are trying to solve and the requirements of the system. Identify the users and their needs, as well as any constraints or limitations of the system. Identify the scope of the system: Define the boundaries of the system, including what the system will do and what it will not do. Research and analyze existing systems: Look at similar systems that have been built in the past and identify what worked well and what didn’t. Use this information to inform your design decisions. Create a high-level design: Outline the main components of the system and how they will interact with each other. This can include a rough diagram of the system’s architecture or a flowchart outlining the process the system will follow. Refine the design: As you work on the details of the design, iterate and refine it until you have a complete and detailed design that meets all the requirements. Document the design: Create detailed documentation of your design for future reference and maintenance. Continuously monitor and improve the system: The system design is not a one-time process; it needs to be continuously monitored and improved to meet the changing requirements. Note that this is a general approach to System Design. For interview-specific answers, see the following resources: How to approach System Design? What are system design questions?

      "Performance vs Scalability": {
        "description": "A service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow. Another way to look at performance vs scalability: If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user. If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

        "description": "Availability refers to the ability of a system to provide its services to clients even in the presence of failures. This is often measured in terms of the percentage of time that the system is up and running, also known as its uptime. Consistency, on the other hand, refers to the property that all clients see the same data at the same time. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the data stored in the system. In distributed systems, it is often a trade-off between availability and consistency. Systems that prioritize high availability may sacrifice consistency, while systems that prioritize consistency may sacrifice availability. Different distributed systems use different approaches to balance the trade-off between availability and consistency, such as using replication or consensus algorithms.

Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures. Networks aren’t reliable, so you’ll need to support partition tolerance. You’ll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.

            "description": "Failover is an availability pattern that is used to ensure that a system can continue to function in the event of a failure. It involves having a backup component or system that can take over in the event of a failure. In a failover system, there is a primary component that is responsible for handling requests, and a secondary (or backup) component that is on standby. The primary component is monitored for failures, and if it fails, the secondary component is activated to take over its duties. This allows the system to continue functioning with minimal disruption. Failover can be implemented in various ways, such as active-passive, active-active, and hot-standby. Active-passive: With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active’s IP address and resumes service. The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in ‘hot’ standby or whether it needs to start up from ‘cold’ standby. Only the active server handles traffic. Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover. Active-active: In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them. If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.

It involves having a backup component or system that can take over in the event of a failure. In a failover system, there is a primary component that is responsible for handling requests, and a secondary (or backup) component that is on standby. The primary component is monitored for failures, and if it fails, the secondary component is activated to take over its duties. This allows the system to continue functioning with minimal disruption. Failover can be implemented in various ways, such as active-passive, active-active, and hot-standby. Active-passive: With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active’s IP address and resumes service. The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in ‘hot’ standby or whether it needs to start up from ‘cold’ standby. Only the active server handles traffic. Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover. Active-active: In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.

A load balancing algorithm is the logic that a load balancer uses to distribute network traffic between servers (an algorithm is a set of predefined rules). There are two primary approaches to load balancing. Dynamic load balancing uses algorithms that take into account the current state of each server and distribute traffic accordingly. Static load balancing distributes traffic without making these adjustments. Some static algorithms send an equal amount of traffic to each server in a group, either in a specified order or at random.",

This type of caching can help improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of times the client needs to request data from the server. One common example of client-side caching is web browsers caching frequently accessed web pages and resources.When a user visits a web page, the browser stores a copy of the page and its resources (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts) in the browser’s cache. If the user visits the same page again, the browser can retrieve the cached version of the page and its resources instead of requesting them from the server, which can reduce the load time of the page.Another example of client-side caching is application-level caching. Some applications, such as mobile apps, can cache data on the client’s device to improve performance and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.Client side caching has some advantages like reducing server load, faster page load times, and reducing network traffic. However, it also has some drawbacks like the potential for stale data if the client-side cache is not properly managed, or consuming memory or disk space on the client’s device.",

If the content is found in the cache, it is served to the user from the nearby server. If the content is not found in the cache, it is requested from the origin server (the original source of the content) and then cached on the nearby server for future requests.CDN caching can significantly improve the performance and availability of a website by reducing the distance that data needs to travel, reducing the load on the origin server, and allowing for faster delivery of content to end-users.",

The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program. Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls. Popular RPC frameworks include Protobuf, Thrift, and Avro.RPC is a request-response protocol:Client program - Calls the client stub procedure. The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.Client stub procedure - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.Client communication module - OS sends the message from the client to the server.Server communication module - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.Server stub procedure - Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.Sample RPC calls:RPC is focused on exposing behaviors. RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.Disadvantage of RPCRPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.It can be difficult to debug RPC.You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box. For example, it might require additional effort to ensure RPC calls are properly cached on caching servers such as Squid.To learn more, visit the following links:",
