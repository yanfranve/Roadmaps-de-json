It is graced with the feature of “memory safety without garbage collection”, an attribute that makes Rust one of its kind. Memory safety is ensuring that software, while accessing the system’s memory, is not causing any leaks, or dangling pointers. In Rust, memory safety is accomplished through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. This system eliminates the need of garbage collection or manual memory management, hence ensuring swift execution of software along with a safer memory environment. This memory management feature in Rust even provides concurrent programming guaranteeing thread safety with options for shared and mutable state access that makes it harder to cause thread unsafety.",

The elements of a tuple can be accessed using dot notation followed by the index starting from 0.Enums (enumerations): These are data structures that allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Enum variants can be simple values or complex ones with fields.Arrays and Vectors: These are collections of items with the same type. An array is fixed-sized, while a vector can grow or shrink its size. Arrays and vectors store elements in contiguous memory locations.Hash Maps: A Hash Map keeps track of elements in key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary or a JavaScript object.

When you are explicitly working with lifetimes in Rust, you are usually dealing with functions that accept references. Rust requires you to annotate the lifetimes when a function has one or more arguments of the borrowed reference type. The annotation is done using a set of angle brackets (<>), and inside these brackets, you declare your lifetime parameters, prefixed with an apostrophe (’). The Rust compiler uses these annotations to reason about how those references relate, and whether they are valid or not. ",

The most common default names for lifetimes are 'a, 'b, 'c, etc. For example, in a function that borrows two strings, and returns a string, explicit lifetimes are used as: fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str.
