These tools allow you to see the overall CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system, which can help identify any resource bottlenecks.\nUse database-specific tools: Most database management systems (DBMSs) have their own tools for monitoring performance. For example, Microsoft SQL Server has the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the sys.dm_os_wait_stats dynamic management view, while Oracle has the Oracle Enterprise Manager and the v$waitstat view. These tools allow you to see specific performance metrics, such as the amount of time spent waiting on locks or the number of physical reads and writes.\nUse third-party tools: There are also several third-party tools that can help you profile the performance of a database. Some examples include SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer, Quest Software Foglight, and Redgate SQL Monitor. These tools often provide more in-depth performance analysis and can help you identify specific issues or bottlenecks.\nAnalyze slow queries: If you have specific queries that are running slowly, you can use tools like EXPLAIN PLAN or SHOW PLAN in MySQL or SQL Server to see the execution plan for the query and identify any potential issues. You can also use tools like the MySQL slow query log or the SQL Server Profiler to capture slow queries and analyze them further.\nMonitor application performance: If you are experiencing performance issues with a specific application that is using the database, you can use tools like Application Insights or New Relic to monitor the performance of the application and identify any issues that may be related to the database.\nHave a look at the documentation for the database that you are using.",

It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or decomposition (improving an existing database design).\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS) and on Microsoft Windows. It depends on the libevent library.\nMemcached’s APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in the least recently used (LRU) order. Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database.\nMemcached has no internal mechanism to track misses which may happen. However, some third-party utilities provide this functionality.\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

                "description": "Search engines are an essential part of any web application, responsible for providing efficient and relevant search results for users. They store and retrieve data based on unique indexes, which allow for fast and accurate searches. As a backend developer, understanding search engines functionalities, and how to integrate them into your web application, is crucial.\n\nThere are two primary types of search engines:\nFull-text search engines: These are specifically designed for searching and analyzing text documents. They can efficiently index large volumes of text and provide relevant results based on keywords or phrases. Popular full-text search engines examples include Elasticsearch, Solr, and Amazon CloudSearch.\nDatabase search engines: Database engines are built-in features of most databases. They provide search capabilities within the data stored in the database. Examples include MySQL FULLTEXT search and PostgreSQL Full-Text Search.\n\n Key Concepts\nWhen dealing with search engines, it’s important to understand these key concepts:\nIndexing: The process of analyzing and storing data in an optimized format for fast search and retrieval.\nTokenization: Breaking text into individual words or terms (also known as tokens), for efficient indexing and searching.\nQuerying: The act of searching the indexed data by asking a specific question or requesting information based on keywords or phrases.\nRelevance scoring: A score assigned to each search result that indicates how closely it matches the query, based on algorithms and relevance models.\n\nIntegration\nTo integrate a search engine into your web application, you would typically follow these steps:\nChoose the search engine: Identify the search engine that best suits your application’s needs, considering factors such as scalability, performance, and ease of integration.\nIndex your data: Analyze and store your data using the chosen search engine. This process may involve creating an index, specifying fields, and defining how the data should be tokenized and analyzed.\nImplement search functionality: Develop the backend code for handling search requests, such as sending queries to the search engine and parsing the responses. Additionally, make sure to handle user inputs, like keywords, phrases, and filters.\nDisplay search results: Design the frontend of your application to show search results in a user-friendly manner, including pagination, sorting, and filters.",

It uses an HTTP connection to send a stream of data from the server to the client, and the client can listen for these events and take action when they are received.\nSSE is useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat systems, stock tickers, and social media feeds. It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.\nTo use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting.\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

A web server establishes a connection to the Internet and facilitates the physical data exchange with other web-connected devices.\nSoftware side:\nA software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The content of these hosted websites is sent to the end user’s device through an HTTP server, which may be accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds.\nBasically, an HTTP request is made by a browser anytime it wants a file that is stored on a web server. The relevant (hardware) web server receives the request, which is then accepted by the appropriate (software) HTTP server, which then locates the requested content and returns it to the browser over HTTP. (If the server cannot locate the requested page, it responds with a 404 error.)\nVisit the following resources to learn more: ",
